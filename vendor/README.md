# vendor/ — self-hosted copies for Probe

Unify's Probe section and the "sounds like" hints match what you write by
meaning, with a small language model that runs in the browser
(`js/semantic.js`, `js/semantic-worker.js`). Everything it needs is kept here,
in this repository, so the page fetches nothing from anyone else's servers and
keeps working whatever happens to the original sources. Nothing here changes
unless someone deliberately replaces it.

These are unmodified copies, kept exactly as published — the same files as
Process Hub's `vendor/`.

## What is here

| Folder | What | Version | Source | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `transformers-3.0.2/` | Transformers.js — loads the model and runs it in the browser. `transformers.min.js` includes ONNX Runtime Web; `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.wasm` is its engine | 3.0.2 (ONNX Runtime Web 1.21.0-dev.20241024-d9ca84ef96) | npm package `@huggingface/transformers@3.0.2`, `dist/`, via cdn.jsdelivr.net | Apache 2.0 (`LICENSE`); ONNX Runtime: MIT (`LICENSE-onnxruntime`) |
| `models/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/` | The model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence embeddings, 8-bit quantised ONNX weights, and its tokenizer | Hugging Face commit `751bff37182d3f1213fa05d7196b954e230abad9` | https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (converted from https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | Apache 2.0 (see the model card, `README.md`; licence text as in `transformers-3.0.2/LICENSE`) |

Check them with `cd vendor && sha256sum -c` and the block above.

## Fingerprints depend on the model

Each browser keeps the fingerprints it has worked out in IndexedDB
(`unify-vectors`), under the model's name. They only mean anything to the
model that made them.

## Upgrading

Only if there is a reason to — a browser stops running it, or a clearly
better model. Put the new version in its own folder (e.g.
`transformers-3.x.y/`), change the paths in `js/semantic-worker.js`, test
with outside network access blocked, and update this file. Remove the old
folder afterwards. A different model also needs a new model name in
`js/semantic.js` (`MODEL`), which tells each browser to work its fingerprints
out again. `sw.js` needs no change: it caches anything under `vendor/` as
it is first read.
